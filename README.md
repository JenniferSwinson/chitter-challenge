This is my attempt at the Chitter Challenge, in the time I have had. It is a React app which enables you to post 'peeps' and displays them in a list with the most recent first, and the date and time displayed as part of each 'peep'. To run the programme, use 'git clone' and then 'npm i' to install the dependencies (React, ReactDOM). Finally 'npm start' in the local terminal will launch the app in the browser.
